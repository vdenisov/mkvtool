/**
 * Probe logic for the native-image failure modes that fail *silently*: a native binary
 * built without `-H:+AddAllCharsets` cannot decode single-byte charsets like
 * Windows-1251, one built without locale-data inclusion returns empty CLDR display
 * names, and a dependency that needs reachability config it did not get fails only when
 * its code is first reached. All work on any ordinary JVM, so only an end-to-end run of
 * the actual native binary catches a broken build - which is what the hidden
 * `native-smoke` command does.
 *
 * The first two functions are deliberately minimal and self-contained. They mirror the v1
 * idioms (`to_utf8.groovy`'s strict decoder and `subst.groovy`'s native-name lookup) and
 * exist only until the real utilities land: the `to-utf8` command will own strict
 * decoding and the external-track language guesser will own native language names. Once
 * those exist the probe can point at them, or retire. Do not grow shared abstractions
 * here in the meantime. The third one already points at the real utility, which is the
 * shape the others should reach.
