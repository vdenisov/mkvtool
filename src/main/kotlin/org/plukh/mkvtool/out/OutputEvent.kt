/**
 * A single unit of output, produced by command logic and consumed by a [Renderer].
 *
 * Command logic emits these events and never writes to a stream or colors anything itself; a
 * [Renderer] owns all presentation. That separation is what lets a text renderer and a
 * machine-readable (JSON) renderer share the same command logic unchanged.
 *
 * Naming rule for this hierarchy and every event added later: fields describe *what a thing means*
 * (e.g. a differing value, a guessed language), never *how it renders* (no "grayed", "highlighted").
 * The renderer maps meaning to presentation (routing, color, padding), so one visual treatment can
 * serve several distinct meanings without the model conflating them.
